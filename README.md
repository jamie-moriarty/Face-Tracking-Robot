# Face-Tracking-Robot
A scooby-doo-esque robot with a camera in it's eye that follows you around until you look at it. Uses a raspberry pi, camera, motors, and OpenCV.


This project uses 3 standard servos, a raspberry pi 3, adafruit's PWM servo driver hat, an rpi camera, and a hand sculupted face with the eye cut out.

There are still a lot of bugs in the code so sorry about that, this was my first ever programming experience and I never went back to refine it.
